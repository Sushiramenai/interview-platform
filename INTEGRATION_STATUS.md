# Video Interview Platform - Integration Status

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Panel - Role Management
- **Fixed**: "Add New Role" button now works correctly
- **Fixed**: Edit buttons for all roles (Customer Support, Product Manager, Sales Rep, Software Engineer) work properly
- **Solution**: Ensured all JavaScript functions are properly exposed to global scope

### 2. Service Requirements
- **Updated**: ElevenLabs is now REQUIRED (not optional)
- **Updated**: Recall.ai is now REQUIRED (not optional)
- **Validation**: System checks all services before allowing interviews
- **UI**: Clear indicators showing which services are configured

### 3. Complete Integration
All services work together as a unified system:

```
Candidate → Google Meet → AI Bot (Recall.ai) → Voice (ElevenLabs) → Recording → Evaluation (Claude)
```

## System Architecture

### Required Services:
1. **Claude AI** - Interview logic and evaluation
2. **Google Meet** - Video platform
3. **ElevenLabs** - AI voice synthesis (MANDATORY)
4. **Recall.ai** - Bot + recording (MANDATORY)

### Interview Flow:
1. HR creates role with custom questions
2. Candidate clicks link and enters details
3. System validates one-shot attempt
4. Opens Google Meet video call
5. AI bot joins and speaks questions
6. Records entire session
7. Evaluates responses automatically
