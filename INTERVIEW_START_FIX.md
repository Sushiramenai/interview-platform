# Interview Start Error - Fix Applied

## Problem
When clicking "Start Interview" after entering name and email, you received:
```
Failed to start interview. Please try again.
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Services Not Initialized** - The orchestrator services weren't ready when trying to start the interview
2. **API Keys Not Loaded** - Environment variables weren't set from ConfigManager
3. **Async Initialization Race** - Services initialized asynchronously but interview could start before they were ready

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Service Initialization**
```javascript
// Now tracks initialization state properly
let servicesInitialized = false;

async function initializeServices() {
  // Loads API keys from ConfigManager
  // Sets environment variables
  // Creates service instances
  servicesInitialized = true;
}
```

### 2. **Pre-Interview Checks**
Before starting any interview:
- Checks if services are initialized
- If not, initializes them on-demand
- Verifies orchestrators are created
- Throws clear error if initialization fails

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
The landing page now shows:
- Specific error messages from the server
- More detailed console logging
- Actual error reason instead of generic message

### 4. **System Status Endpoint**
Added `/api/system/status` to check:
- Services initialization state
- API keys loaded
- Environment variables set
- Orchestrators created

## How It Works Now

1. **On Server Start:**
   - ConfigManager initializes
   - API keys are loaded
   - Services initialize in background

2. **When Starting Interview:**
   - Checks if services are ready
   - If not, initializes them synchronously
   - Ensures all API keys are in environment
   - Creates interview session

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Shows specific error (e.g., "Claude AI is not configured")
   - Logs detailed debugging information
   - Falls back to manual mode if bot fails

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

### 1. Check System Status
Visit: `/api/system/status`

Should show:
```json
{
  "servicesInitialized": true,
  "apiKeys": {
    "claude": true,
    "google": true,
    "elevenlabs": true
  },
  "orchestrators": {
    "selfHosted": true,
    "manual": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Check Browser Console
Look for errors like:
- "Claude AI is not configured"
- "Voice synthesis (ElevenLabs) is not configured"
- "Failed to initialize interview services"

### 3. Verify API Keys
1. Go to Admin Panel â†’ API Configuration
2. Ensure all 3 keys show as configured
3. Test each key individually

### 4. Server Logs
Check server console for:
- ðŸ”„ Initializing services...
- ðŸ“¦ Loaded API keys: { claude: true, google: true, elevenlabs: true }
- âœ… All services initialized successfully

## Result

The interview should now start successfully when:
- All 3 API keys are configured
- Services have initialized
- Valid role is selected

You'll see the Google Meet window open with instructions for the AI interviewer to join!
