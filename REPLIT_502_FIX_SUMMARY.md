# Replit 502 Error Fix Summary

## Problem
After adding the 3 API keys on Replit, you received a 502 error when trying to save them.

## Root Causes
1. Replit's proxy wasn't being trusted by Express
2. CORS configuration was too restrictive for Replit's environment
3. Cookie settings weren't compatible with Replit's proxy
4. Missing proper error handling for proxy timeouts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Configuration (`index.js`)
- Added `app.set('trust proxy', true)` to trust Replit's proxy
- Updated CORS to allow all origins with credentials
- Changed server binding from default to `0.0.0.0` for Replit
- Added `/health` endpoint for monitoring
- Increased body parser limits to 10MB
- Fixed duplicate CORS configuration

### 2. Replit Configuration (`.replit`)
- Created proper Replit configuration file
- Set port mapping: internal 3000 → external 80
- Configured deployment settings

### 3. Admin UI (`src/ui/admin.html`)
- Added specific 502 error detection and handling
- Improved error messages for Replit timeouts
- Kept credentials as 'same-origin' for security

## How to Test

1. **On Replit:**
   ```bash
   # The server should start automatically
   # If not, run:
   npm start
   ```

2. **Navigate to Admin Panel:**
   - Go to `/login`
   - Use admin credentials
   - Navigate to API Configuration

3. **Add API Keys:**
   - Enter your Claude API key
   - Enter Google Service Account JSON
   - Enter ElevenLabs API key
   - Click "Save All API Keys"

4. **If you still get 502:**
   - Wait 10 seconds and try again (Replit cold start)
   - Use the fallback script: `node setup-api-keys.js`

## Fallback Option

If the web UI continues to have issues on Replit, use the command-line tool:

```bash
node setup-api-keys.js
```

This bypasses the web interface entirely and saves keys directly.

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Replit Secrets:
- `SESSION_SECRET` (any random string)
- `NODE_ENV` (set to "production" for Replit)

## Next Steps

Your system is now configured for Replit deployment with:
- ✅ All Recall.ai functionality removed
- ✅ Self-hosted AI bot mode active
- ✅ Replit proxy compatibility
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Fallback configuration options

The platform will use ElevenLabs for voice synthesis and Claude AI for the interview bot.
