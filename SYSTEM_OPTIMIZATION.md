# Senbird Interview System - Optimized Configuration

## Overview
The interview system has been streamlined to provide the best interview experience without requiring complex configuration. All interview behavior is optimized based on best practices and is built directly into the system.

## What Was Removed
- **AI Guidelines Configuration**: No more confusing settings for interview style, follow-up frequency, personality traits, etc.
- **AI Templates**: Removed customizable behavior templates
- **Complex Settings UI**: Simplified dashboard focused on essentials

## Built-in Optimal Behaviors

### Interview Style
- **Professional and Approachable**: The AI maintains a formal yet friendly demeanor
- **Clear Communication**: Single questions asked clearly without compound sentences
- **Natural Flow**: Smooth transitions between questions with brief acknowledgments

### Follow-up Questions
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically identifies when follow-ups are needed
- **30% Probability**: For complete answers, 30% chance of diving deeper
- **Maximum 2 Follow-ups**: Prevents over-probing on any single question
- **Always Follows Up On**:
  - Very short answers (< 10 words)
  - Vague responses lacking specifics
  - Partial answers missing key points

### Response Handling
- **Intent Recognition**: Properly understands:
  - "Can you repeat that?" → Repeats question
  - "What do you mean?" → Provides clarification
  - "I don't know" → Accepts as valid answer and moves on
  - Complete answers → Acknowledges and continues

### Timing
- **3-Second Pause**: After acknowledgments before next question
- **Natural Pacing**: Gives candidates time to think and respond
- **No Rushing**: Patient with responses

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Consistency**: Every interview maintains high professional standards
2. **Simplicity**: HR managers only need to:
   - Set up API keys
   - Create interviews with candidate info
   - Share interview links
3. **Quality**: Based on proven interview best practices
4. **No Confusion**: No settings to misconfigure or misunderstand

## What HR Managers Still Control

1. **Custom Questions**: Full control over interview questions
2. **Job Descriptions**: Can provide context for better interviews
3. **Voice Selection**: Choose from ElevenLabs voices (if configured)
4. **Interview Templates**: Save and reuse question sets
